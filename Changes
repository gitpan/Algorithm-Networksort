Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::Networksort.

0.01  Fri Jan 24 23:55:59 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-X -nAlgorithm::Networksort
1.00  Fri Oct 17 2003
	- Released.
1.01  Sat Oct 25 2003
	- Stupid error in my test scripts prevented them from
	  reading the zero_one.pl file.  Fixed.
1.02  Tue Dec 9 2003
	- Little document formating errors bother me.
	- Another stupid error.  Function nw_text_graph(), used
	  by nw_graph(), was printing directly, not returning a
	  string.  It's an old function, that's how it originally
	  was designed.
	- Added the graphing options (hz_margin, indent, etc.)
	  to nw_graph().
	- Merge in the nw_group_parallel() function (moved from
	  parallel.pl in the eg subdirectory) into nw_group(),
	  fairly painlessly as it turned out.
1.03   Sat Dec 13 2003
	- Added 'title' to the eps and svg graphing options.
	- Added 'namespace' to the svg graphing options.  Added
	  it to the svg.pl script in the eg subdirectory.
