Algorithm::Networksort version 1.24
===================================

This module will create sorting networks, a sequence of comparisons
that do not depend upon the results of prior comparisons.

Since the sequences and their order never change, they can be very
useful if deployed in hardware, or used in software with a compiler
that can take advantage of parallelism.  However, the arrangement of
the comparisons is fixed according to the number of elements to be
sorted, so a network cannot be used as a generic sort like
quicksort.

There are several algorithms to generate sorting networks.  This
module has three of them:  Bose and Nelson's, Hibbard's, and
Batcher's Merge Exchange.  It also has networks that were found
to be superior in comparison count to those generated automatically
by these algorithms.

There is a flexible formatting function that will allow you to
print out your network in many ways (see documentation).  There
is also a graphical output function that will return the network
in an encapsulated postscript, SVG, or text form.

NOTE: Post version 1.08, there was a severe error in the SVG graphing
code that would prevent the SVG graph from being displayed. The error
has been corrected in this version.

INSTALLATION

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The usual way.  Unpack the archive:
	gzip -d Algorithm-Networksort-1.24.tar.gz
	tar xvf Algorithm-Networksort-1.24.tar

This package now makes use of Module::Build, and the Build.PL script,
but you can still use Makefile.PL, which is provided:

Go into the resulting directory, and type:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make

Run the tests:
	make test

Install the module:
	make install

Alternatively, you can use Build.PL:
	perl Build.PL
	perl Build

Run the tests:
	perl Build test

Install the module:
	perl Build install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no other modules and libraries.  If you want
to view the SVG output, good starting points would be Inkscape, Firefox
(version 3.6 or better), and Apache's Batik project for Java.
Postscript viewing is easily accomplished with GNU's ghostview program.
